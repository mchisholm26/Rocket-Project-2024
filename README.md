# Rocket-Project-2024
#The purpose of this code is to control the rocket being launched by Engineering Club at Cornell College in April 2024.
## Hardware

* [TeensyÂ® 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)
* [SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout - KX134 (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17589)
* [MPL3115A2 - I2C Barometric Pressure/Altitude/Temperature Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1893)

#Objectives: 1) detect lauch 2) Alter Sampling Rate upon descend 3) write all data to SD card for later calculation

#Teensy reads data from accelerometer and barometer, writes to SD Card
#desired data from barometer: altitude
#desired data from accelerometer: acceleration (all 3 axes)
